# ecommerce-api

## How it works 
the endpoints in local development
 - http://localhost:8080/api/products?search="itemName"
 - http://localhost:8080/api/product/:id
 
## Why mongodb?
I chose mongodb because I already had experience with nosql with firebase, but I wanted to try something new and the pricing for mongo db allowed me to try more things

### required dependencies
- express
- mongoose
- cors
